# Low Poly  
  
Inspired by [Imphenzia's 10 minute challenges](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzfWju7SFoWLCyV_gDVCrGA/videos) I 
decided to try a bit of low poly work in [Cheetah 3D](https://www.cheetah3d.com), with the aim to being able to build something in 10 minutes.  
That said I am not aiming for 10 minutes, just aiming to build some models.

1.  A Spaceship
2.  Imperial Star Destroyer
3.  Road Trip
