# Low Poly  
  
Inspired by [Imphenzia's 10 minute challenges](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzfWju7SFoWLCyV_gDVCrGA/videos) I 
decided to try a bit of low poly work in [Cheetah 3D](https://www.cheetah3d.com), with the aim to eventually build 
something in 10 minutes, though initially it's going to many, many 10s of minutes.   

1.  A Spaceship
